# Map icons

Used for the tracking map: start pin, end pin (destination), vehicle.

- **Vehicle** is loaded from Flaticon CDN (box truck).
- **Start** and **End** use local files below. You can replace them with Flaticon downloads.

## Use Flaticon “Placeholder” for destination

The destination icon was set to Flaticon’s [placeholder (854904)](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/placeholder_854904); their CDN often returns 404. To use that icon:

1. Open https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/placeholder_854904  
2. Download **SVG** or **PNG**  
3. Save it here as **`map-pin-end.svg`** (or `map-pin-end.png` and update `mapIcons.js` to use it)

Same idea for start: download a pin from Flaticon and save as **`map-pin-start.svg`**.
