## 1. Hero Section

The most critical section. If this fails, visitors won't scroll further.

### Required Elements

| Element          | Purpose                          | Copy Guidance                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title**        | Explain the VALUE you provide    | Don't just describe what you do—explain what happens when they use it. "Generate more traffic" > "Marketing agency" |
| **Subtitle**     | Explain HOW the value is created | Include the method and optionally WHO it's for. "We building high-converting websites for small businesses"         |
| **Visual**       | Help them imagine the outcome    | Show product in use, the experience, or the person behind the service                                               |
| **Social Proof** | Make claims believable           | Logos, numbers ("5,000 customers"), years in business                                                               |
| **CTA**          | Tell them what to do next        | One clear action: "Get Started", "Book a Call", "Buy Now"                                                           |

### Hero Copy Formula

```
Title: [Value/Outcome they get]
Subtitle: [How you deliver it] + [Who it's for]
CTA: [Specific next action]
```

### Examples

**Stripe:**

- Title: "Payment infrastructure for the internet"
- Subtitle: "Millions of companies of all sizes from startups to Fortune 500 use Stripe"
- Visual: Shows analytics dashboard AND customer checkout experience

**Service Provider:**

- Title: "Double your website conversions in 90 days"
- Subtitle: "Strategic copywriting for B2B SaaS companies"
- Visual: Photo of the person (helps visualize who they're hiring)
- Social Proof: "Work completed for [brand logos]"

## 2. Features & Benefits

Deliver on the promise made in the hero. Explain HOW it works.

### Features vs Benefits

| Type        | Definition                   | Example (Tesla)                                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Feature** | Technical specs, what it has | "200 mph top speed", "120 horsepower"                   |
| **Benefit** | What happens when you use it | "Stay connected anywhere", "Immersive sound experience" |

### The Mario Principle

> The **feature** is "we have a flower." The **benefit** is "you can throw fireballs."

Always connect features TO benefits. Don't just list specs—explain what those specs mean for the user.

### Structure Options

**Short format:** 3-4 key benefits with icons
**Long format:** Detailed feature sections with visuals

---

## 3. Additional Social Proof

Reinforce credibility after explaining how it works.

### Types

- **Logos:** Companies you've worked with
- **Testimonials:** Quotes from customers (with photos/names)
- **Numbers:** "10,000+ customers", "$2M saved for clients"
- **Case studies:** Brief success stories
- **Press mentions:** "As seen in..."

---

## 4. FAQ Section

Handle objections before they become reasons not to buy.

### Purpose

A landing page is a sales presentation without a live salesperson. FAQs predict and answer the questions that would prevent purchase.

### Identifying Objections

Think about why someone might NOT buy:

- Price concerns
- Trust issues
- Technical questions
- Timing doubts
- Comparison to alternatives

### Format

```markdown
**Q: [Common objection phrased as question]**

A: [Direct answer that addresses the concern]
```

---

## 5. Final Call to Action

Last chance before they leave. Repeat the CTA.

### Rules

- Never end the page without a clear next step
- Can include a summary of value proposition
- Often includes urgency or a reminder of the benefit

### Format Options

```
[Headline restating value]
[Brief supporting text]
[CTA Button]
```

---

## 6. Footer

Organizational element for navigation and legal requirements.

### Common Elements

- Site navigation links
- Newsletter signup
- Social media links
- Legal pages (Privacy, Terms)
- Contact information
